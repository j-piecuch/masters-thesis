abstract = {Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) is a comprehensive, general-purpose programming system which is being developed as a research project. The initial Multics system will be implemented on the GE 645 computer. One of the overall design goals is to create a computing system which is capable of meeting almost all of the present and near-future requirements of a large computer utility. Such systems must run continuously and reliably 7 days a week, 24 hours a day in a way similar to telephone or power systems, and must be capable of meeting wide service demands: from multiple man-machine interaction to the sequential processing of absentee-user jobs; from the use of the system with dedicated languages and subsystems to the programming of the system itself; and from centralized bulk card, tape, and printer facilities to remotely located terminals. Such information processing and communication systems are believed to be essential for the future growth of computer use in business, in industry, in government and in scientific laboratories as well as stimulating applications which would be otherwise undone.},

title = {Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment},
year = {2013},
isbn = {0321637739},
publisher = {Addison-Wesley Professional},
edition = {3rd},
abstract = {For more than twenty years, serious C programmers have relied on one book for practical, in-depth knowledge of the programming interfaces that drive the UNIX and Linux kernels: W. Richard Stevens Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment . Now, once again, Richs colleague Steve Rago has thoroughly updated this classic work. The new third edition supports todays leading platforms, reflects new technical advances and best practices, and aligns with Version 4 of the Single UNIX Specification. Steve carefully retains the spirit and approach that have made this book so valuable. Building on Richs pioneering work, he begins with files, directories, and processes, carefully laying the groundwork for more advanced techniques, such as signal handling and terminal I/O. He also thoroughly covers threads and multithreaded programming, and socket-based IPC. This edition covers more than seventy new interfaces, including POSIX asynchronous I/O, spin locks, barriers, and POSIX semaphores. Most obsolete interfaces have been removed, except for a few that are ubiquitous. Nearly all examples have been tested on four modern platforms: Solaris 10, Mac OS X version 10.6.8 (Darwin 10.8.0), FreeBSD 8.0, and Ubuntu version 12.04 (based on Linux 3.2). As in previous editions, youll learn through examples, including more than ten thousand lines of downloadable, ISO C source code. More than four hundred system calls and functions are demonstrated with concise, complete programs that clearly illustrate their usage, arguments, and return values. To tie together what youve learned, the book presents several chapter-length case studies, each reflecting contemporary environments. Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment has helped generations of programmers write code with exceptional power, performance, and reliability. Now updated for todays systems, this third edition will be even more valuable.}
